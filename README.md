This Repo hosts the code described in this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09507). It deals with creating space filling designs with a split plot structure. 
There are 2 files, one with the necessary functions, one with the simulation examples from the paper.
For any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me!
